# Azul Rojo

Azul Rojo, community projects, ideas. To help uplift our communities.


## Components
- components should have 2 themes `light` and `dark`. the main reason to do this is becuase we want to let components be independent of each other. in the future we can pull them out and reuse them for other projects.
