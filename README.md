this site is going to be the canvas for all community projects and all other projects that I find beneficial more than myself. 

for starters the first one is survival kits. 
Some resources:
- a
- b
- c

The idea is that we may have the urge to help a homeless person but donâ€™t know how. The start is with these kits. For example a food kit can help them get nutrition to continue to survive. 

Our posters:
- small
- large


Finally: enjoy this song we used as inspiration and as we build out this canvas more fully.
